# denon-rs232

Remote control a denon 2308 over the COM Port with RS-232.

Probably works for many other denon AVR's. For other commands see the attached PDF.

Default COM Port is `/dev/ttyS0`. You can change this in the py file.

Connect the Serial Port to the Denon RS-232 Port and run the python script:

`python web.py`

Then navigate to: 

`http://your_ip:25000/`
